# cypress-project

### The project was built using POM(Page Object Model) to reuse the methods in the tests. This helps reduce code duplication and improve test case management.

### Intructions to run the tests

## Installing Cypress

`npm install cypress --save-dev`

### Installing dependecies:

`npm install`

### Running tests from root folder:

`npx cypress run`


### Running the tests in UI mode:

`npm run cy:open`

## As the environment is opened I always created the user admin to use in the tests, so the tests have the right order to not fail
## Users and products are deleted by tests.
